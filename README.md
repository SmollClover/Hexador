The Purpose of this Project was to create a File Encrpytion Tool that always generates different outputs while using the same inputs.

So far it has worked fine, except for the fact that it can only encrypt UTF-8 characters and not raw bytes. That's because of an inherit flaw of me being dumb.

This Project is dead since I don't plan on making any changes to it.
